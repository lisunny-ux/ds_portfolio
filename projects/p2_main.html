        <h2>Project Two: Music Genre Clustering</h2>
        
        <p>This project explores clustering music into distinct genres using a variety of audio characteristics. The data cleaning process included normalizing 
            relevant variables and removing those with low variance or strong multicollinearity. Each variable’s impact on clustering performance was evaluated
             using KMeans, and variables with correlations below 0.6 were removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                To determine the optimal number of clusters, silhouette scores were calculated across multiple cluster counts, with seven emerging as the ideal choice. 
                The resulting clusters were then reduced to two dimensions and visualized using UMAP. Using the provided genre labels, genre purity scores were 
                calculated to assess clustering accuracy. Of the genres analyzed, 48 showed weak correlation, 35 moderate, 19 good, 7 excellent, and 5 very weak 
                alignment with the generated clusters.
            </p>
        <p>  In the future, I plan on applying different clustering methods, such as Gaussian Mixture Models, Spherical Clustering, or Hierarchical Clustering in hopes
            of improving clustering accuracy.
