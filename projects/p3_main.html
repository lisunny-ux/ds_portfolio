        <h2>Project Three: Chicago School Performance and Crime Rate</h2>
        
        <p>Through geospatial analysis, this project aims to visualize and quantify the relationship between crime rates and 
            school performance among elementary and high schools in Chicago. The project incorporates GeoPandas, 
            geospatial visualization tools, and standard regression models. A strong understanding of the underlying data was 
            especially important during the data cleaning process, particularly when determining which test scores were both 
            abundant and representative of school performance. Collaboration for this project was conducted through GitHub, 
            utilizing version control and other core GitHub tools.
